DIGITIZATION PROGRESS REPORTS
=================

A resource for generating digitization effort graphs (or other efforts) on-the-fly.

More generally, for a series of entities (e.g., "Collections") and a series of activities
(e.g., "High Resolution Images"), this project takes a count of:

#. Total proposed units of activity
#. Total completed units of activity

combined with:

#. Project Start
#. Present
#. Project End
#. Project Extension End

and generates a figure like this:
